# electron-emotional-state
A small electron app made for personal use to send a text through a webhook in discord describing the color state and if the user is non-verbal. 
I ask that any and all work based on this to always remain free, as this is a tool to help people like myself who struggle to verbally communicate their emotional state to people.
